# :books: RevoU Project: TheLook eCommerce Analysis

### :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Introduction
Hi, I'm Aji. Recently, I joined RevoU Mini Course Data Analytics. Here, I am given a task to analyze data from Bigquery Public Data named 'TheLook eCommerce' dataset. 
TheLook eCommerce dataset is a fictitious dataset that shows us about the sales of clothes product around the world. This dataset contains 4 table, which is user,
product, orders, and order items. 

### :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Challenge
In this project, I was given a challenge by RevoU to give an insight or at least 3 insight from this dataset. Started by making a business question or insight question, queried by using Google Cloud BigQuery, imported it to Spreadsheet to be cleaned, and visualized it by using Tableau Public.

### :notebook_with_decorative_cover: Results
Here I attach my SQL [BigQuery syntax](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?sq=1073902271305:a9feab1e40b84252aebea8a552a52161) for this challenge as well as my [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/ajimas.galung.candra/viz/RevoUProject-ClotheseCommerceAnalysis/Dashboard1). Above, I also have my result in terms of PDF power point as well as the insight that I gained from this dataset
